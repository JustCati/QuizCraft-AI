### **Task Instruction:**
You are tasked with extracting **only the main text** from this Image depicting formatted document or slides. The main text consists of **titles** and **content text** that appear on the image. The text may be in **English** or **Italian**. Do not extract any text that appears in headers, footers, within images, or as hyperlinks or URLs.

### **What to Extract:**
1. **Titles:** Extract the main title or heading of the image. This is typically the largest text or bold text at the top of the image.
2. **Content Text:** Extract all bullet points, paragraphs, or body content that appear beneath the title. This includes definitions, explanations, or any descriptive text directly related to the imageâ€™s topic.

### **What to Ignore:**
1. **Headers:** Ignore any text that appears in the top part of the image if it seems to serve as a repeating header or template element.
2. **Footers:** Ignore all footnotes, page numbers, or any repeated footer text such as copyright information or image numbers.
3. **Image Text:** Ignore any text that is embedded within images, charts, or diagrams. Focus only on text that is written as part of the image layout.
4. **URLs and Hyperlinks:** Exclude any web addresses, URLs, or hyperlinks, whether embedded in the content or displayed as text.
5. **Logos or Watermarks:** Ignore any small text related to branding, logos, or watermarks.

### **Guidelines for Extraction:**
- **Language:** The text will be either in **English** or **Italian**. Ensure that both languages are supported in your extraction.
- **Size & Position:** Prioritize larger, central text (likely titles) and body text in the middle of the image for extraction.
- **Visual Cues:** If text is in a standard text box format and is not overlaid on an image, it should be considered for extraction.
- **Ignore Decorations:** Any decorative or graphical text elements, like stylized words over images or diagrams, should be ignored.
- **Consistency:** Extract text consistently from each image, following the same logic to ensure uniformity across all images.
