Also, while discriminative models such as the logistic regressor are unstable when data is linearly separable, generative approaches do not suffer from this limitation.  \\nGenerative models are so called because, by modeling the distribution of the data, they provide a complete data model which may also be used to generate new data following the joint probability distribution  \\n$$\\nP(X,Y)\\n$$  \\neven if they are mainly used to perform classification in this context.', 'Discriminative models:  \\n• choose n-gram weights to improve a task, not to fit the  training set  \\nParsing-based models  \\nCaching Models  \\nRecently used words are more likely to appear  \\n$$\\n{}_{I E}(w\\\\mid h i s t o r y)=\\\\lambda P(w_{i}\\\\mid w_{i-2}w_{i-1})+(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\frac{c(w\\\\in h i s t o r y)}{\\\\mid h i s t o r y\\\\mid}\\n$$  \\nThese turned out to perform very poorly for speech recognition', '30.1.

For instance, if our dataset contains 800 non-spam e-mails and 200 spam e-mails, we can assume that $P(0)=0.2\\\\$ and $P(1)=0.8$ .\\nAlternatively, we could study what is the proportion of examples in each class in the real world. In the case of spam detection, we could ask a large sample of people how many e-mails they receive in average and how many spam e-mails they receive. These numbers can be used to define the prior probability.\\nAnother common choice, when we don’t have enough information on the phenomenon is to assume that all classes are equally probable, in which case $\\\\begin{array}{r}{P(C)=\\\\frac{1}{m},}\\\\end{array}$ , where $m$ is the number of classes.  \\nThere are many ways to define the prior probability. However, it should be considered that this quantity should be interpreted in Bayesian terms. This means that, by specifying a prior probability, we are introducing our degree of belief on what classes are more or less likely in the system.', 'We want to build a spam filter which decides whether a given email is spam or not. In this case, we can consider $\\\\chi$ as the set of all possible emails and $\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ , with 1 indicating spam and 0 indicating non-spam. Let $f$ be a function counting the number of orthographical mistakes of a given email $x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}$ :  \\n$$\\nf:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to R^{+}\\n$$  \\nWe can determine if a given email $x$ is spam or not by counting the number of mistakes and checking whether this number exceeds a pre-determined threshold $\\\\theta$ . We can hence define our function $h$ as follows:  \\n$$\\nh(x)={\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{{\\\\mathrm{if~}}f(x)>\\\\theta}\\\\\\\\ {0}&{{\\\\mathrm{otherwise}}}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.}\\n$$  \\nAs we will later see, this is a trivial example of a parametric classifier with one parameter.', 'We will now see a simple application of the MAP principle which makes use of the direct estimation of the probability $P(X|C)$ in the case of discrete features. In particular, we will consider an example with two discrete features, so that we have to estimate $P(X_{1},X_{2}|C)$ .  \\nLet’s say we want to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on the presence of the following words:  \\nOffer (F1): Yes/No Free (F2): Yes/No  \\nEach of these can be considered a binary feature which can either be present or not. Hence both Offer and Free have two possible values “Yes” and $\"{\\\\mathsf{N O}}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}.$']\n",

This can be seen in more general terms as:  \\n$$\\nP(X=x)=\\\\sum_{y}P(X=x,Y=y)\\n$$  \\nThe act of computing $P(X)$ from $P(X,Y)$ is also known as marginalization.', 'We now want to estimate the probabilities $P(X_{1},X_{2}|C)$ . One way to do it is to estimate the two following joint probabilities:  \\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{l}{{\\\\cdot\\\\ P(O f f e r,F r e e|S p a m)}}\\\\\\\\ {{\\\\cdot\\\\ P(O f f e r,F r e e|H a m)}}\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\nWe will estimate each of them with a contingency table.']\n",

In particular, we will consider an example with two discrete features, so that we have to estimate $P(X_{1},X_{2}|C)$ .  \\nLet’s say we want to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on the presence of the following words:  \\nOffer (F1): Yes/No Free (F2): Yes/No  \\nEach of these can be considered a binary feature which can either be present or not. Hence both Offer and Free have two possible values “Yes” and $\"{\\\\mathsf{N O}}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}.$', '• Naïve bayes classifiers can use any sort of feature • URL, email address, dictionaries  \\nBut if, as in the previous slides • We use only word features we use all of the words in the text (not a subset)  \\nThen  \\n• Naive bayes has an important similarity to language modeling.', 'We have seen that probabilities can be factorized using the product rule.

That is, if the examples are represented by the multimodal random variable $X=[X_{1},\\\\ldots,X_{n}]$ (features) and $C$ (class):  \\n$$\\nX_{i\\\\perp}\\\\vert\\\\boldsymbol{X}_{j}\\\\vert\\\\boldsymbol{C},\\\\forall i\\\\neq j\\n$$  \\nIf $X_{i}$ and $X_{j}$ are word counts, then we are saying that if I take all non-spam emails, then the number of occurrences of a given word does not influence the number of occurrences of another word. This is obviously not true in general-mails of different topics. If the e-mail is about a vacation, the words ‘trip’, ‘flight’, ‘luggage’ will appear often. Instead, if the e-mail is about work, the words ‘meeting’, ‘report’, ‘time’, will appear more often. This means that, within the same category (non-spam e-mails), the number of occurrences of a word (e.g., ‘trip’) may be related to the number of occurrences of another words (e.g., ‘flight’), which breaks the assumption of conditional independence. This is why this assumption is called naïve assumption. With this in mind, it should be considered that, despite such naïve assumption, the Naïve Bayes Classifier works surprisingly well in many contexts.  \\nWe know that:  \\n$$\\nX\\\\bot Y|Z\\\\Leftrightarrow P\\\\left(X,Y|Z\\\\right)=P\\\\left(X|Z\\\\right)P\\\\left(Y|Z\\\\right)\\n$$  \\nHence, we discover that, under the assumption of conditional independence:  \\n$$\\nP\\\\left(X_{1},\\\\ldots,X_{n}|C\\\\right)=P\\\\left(X_{1}|C\\\\right)P\\\\left(X_{2}|C\\\\right)\\\\ldots P(X_{n}|C)\\n$$  \\nSo, we can re-write the MAP classification rule as:  \\n$$\\nf(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\arg_{c}m a x P\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}_{1}|c\\\\right)(\\\\mathbf{x}_{2}|c)\\\\ldots P\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}_{n}|c\\\\right)P(c)\\n$$  \\nThe single $P(X_{1}|C)$ terms are now easy to model, since $X_{1}$ is mono-dimensional. In practice, depending on the considered problem, we can model these terms in different ways. Two common approaches, depending on the data, are to use a Gaussian distribution or a Multinomial distribution.  \\nWhen we use Gaussian distributions to model the $P(X_{i}|C)$ terms, the classification method is called “Gaussian Naïve Bayes). Similarly, if we consider a multinomial distribution, the classification method is called “Multinomial Naïve Bayes”.', 'Let us consider the problem of classifying e-mail messages as spam or nonspam, with the e-mails represented with bag of words (a representation which counts the number of occurrences of each word given a vocabulary), with vocabulary size equal to 20000 words.

Similarly, if ${\\\\cal Y}(0)\\\\perp{\\\\cal Y}(1)|T,$ then the treatment is the only thing generating a difference between the outcome in the treated and in the control group.  \\nIf this conditional independence is valid, then:  \\n$$\\nE[Y(0)|T=0]=E[Y(0)|T=1]=E[Y(0)]\\n$$  \\nand:  \\n$$\\nE[Y(1)|T=0]=E[Y(1)|T=1]=E[Y(1)]\\n$$  \\nWhich leads to:  \\n$$\\n1)|T=1|-E[Y(0)|T=0]=E[Y(1)]-E[Y(0)]=E[Y(1)-Y(10|T)].\\n$$  \\nHence, in this case, correlation would be causation.']\n",

Indeed, while $P(D i a g n o s i s=1|r a d i u s1)$ needs to be in the [0, 1] range, the linear combination $\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}r a d i u s1$ will naturally output values smaller than 0 and larger than 1. How should we interpret such values?  \\nIntuitively, we would expect to $P(D i a g n o s i s=1|r a d i u s1)$ to assume values in the [0, 1] range for intermediate values (say $\\\\left(\\\\mathsf{r a d i u s}\\\\right)\\\\in\\\\left[10,20\\\\right]\\\\right)$ , while for extremely low values of (say $\\\\left(\\\\mathsf{r a d i u s}\\\\right)<10)$ the probability should saturate to 0 and for extremely large values (say $\\\\boxed{\\\\ r a d i u s}>20)$ the probability should saturate to 1.  \\nWhen radius1  takes large values (say larger than 20), we expect probability to saturate to 1.  \\nIn practice, we would expect a result similar to the following:  \\nAs can be noted, the function above is not linear, and hence it cannot be fit with a linear regressor. However, we have seen that a linear regressor can be tweaked to also represent nonlinear functions.', 'With either histograms or mobile windows, we have considered regions with a fixed size (e.g., the bandwidth $h$ ). In practice, this may lead to regions with very few or zero examples and regions with many examples. This can bring some limitations as density estimates relying on fewer points will be more unstable (they will have a higher variance) and we will not be able to reliably estimate a density in areas where there are fewer points.  \\nWhile one way to mitigate this is to use smoother kernels (e.g., the Gaussian one) assigning a non-zero weight to each example, another approach is to choose a neighborhood of x such that the number of elements in the neighborhood, besides $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is exactly equal to $K,$ where $K$ is an hyper-parameter. The advantage of this approach is to always rely on the same sample sample size when estimating the density.  \\nLet $N(\\\\mathbf{x},r)$ be a neighborhood centered at x with radius $r$ . We will define $R_{K}$ as the radius of the largest neighborhood centered at $\\\\mathbf{x}$ containing at most $K$ examples, besides ${\\\\bf x}$ (if it is included in $\\\\mathbf{x}$ ):  \\n$$\\nR_{K}(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\operatorname*{sup}\\\\{r:|N(\\\\mathbf{x},r)\\\\setminus\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\}|\\\\leq K\\\\}\\n$$  \\nWe will also define $N_{K}({\\\\bf x})$ as the largest neighborhood of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ containing at most $K$ elements:  \\n$$\\n{\\\\cal N}_{K}({\\\\bf x})=N({\\\\bf x},R_{K}({\\\\bf x}))\\n$$  \\nK-NN density estimation will assign point ${\\\\bf x}$ the following density estimate:  \\n$$\\nf\\\\mathbf{(x)}=\\\\frac{K}{|\\\\mathbf{X}|}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{V_{d}\\\\cdot R_{K}^{d}(\\\\mathbf{x})}\\n$$  \\nWhere $V_{d}$ is the volume of the unit d-dimensional ball and $V_{d}\\\\cdot R_{k}^{d}({\\\\bf x})$ is hence the volume of the d-dimensional ball of radius $R_{K}({\\\\bf x})$ . Intuitively, if $R_{k}({\\\\bf x})$ is large, then we are in an area which is not very dense, so we will assign a small density value.  \\nThe figure below exemplifies the computation in 2D:  \\nThe plot below shows density estimates for different values of $K$ :  \\nAs we can see, $K$ acts as the bandwidth in the previous case, effectively determining the size of the neighborhoods in an adaptive way.  \\nWe will not see more details on this method, as kernel Density Estimation is in practice the most used non-parametric density estimation method. However, we will see how this approach will turn useful and practical to define classification algorithms.', 'One may think that a model minimizing the empirical risk will be the best possible one. However, especially when the training set is not large enough (as compared to the complexity of the model) or not representative enough of the joint probability distribution $P(X,Y),$ , the estimation of the empirical risk may be limited. As an example, consider the following model:  \\n$$\\n\\\\hat{h}(x)=y\\\\mathrm{s.t.}(x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{TR}\\n$$  \\nThe hypothesis $\\\\hat{h}$ defined above will lead to an empirical risk equal to 0 as long as the loss function is defined in such a way that $L(y,y)=0$ . Indeed:  \\n$$\\nR_{e m p}(\\\\hat{h}(x))=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\\\cal L}(y,y)=0\\n$$  \\nHowever, the function above will not be defined for any value:  \\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{\\\\psi}_{x^{\\\\prime}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}_{\\\\textrm{s.t.}}(x^{\\\\prime},y)\\\\not\\\\in\\\\mathrm{~TR~}\\\\forall y\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Y}\\n$$  \\nSince we expect the training set to be a sample from the distribution $P(X,Y),$ we expect such values $x^{\\\\prime}$ to exist (otherwise the training is the population, which is in general not true).  \\nThe example above is an extreme case of a phenomenon called overfitting, which happens when a given hypothesis achieves a low error on the training set, but the solution is not general enough to obtain similar performance (i.e., a similar risk) on data not belonging to the training set.  \\nThe phenomenon of overfitting is often related to the capacity of the model. A model with a large capacity can represent very complex functions $h$ and result in overfitting, while a model is a small capacity can represent relatively simple functions $h,$ making overfitting harder, but possibly resulting in an underfitting model, i.e., a model which is too simple, and as a result cannot reach a low empirical risk.  \\nThis is best seen with the simple regression example below:  \\nThe example shows the fit of three polynomial regression models of different degrees (the first one is degree 1, which corresponds to a linear regressor). As can be noted:  \\nA lower degree polynomial (e.g., a line - left) will lead to underfitting. In this  \\ncase, the model is too simple to model the data well, so the empirical risk will be large;\\nA higher degree polynomial (right) will minimize the empirical risk but find a complex model which will not describe well data which has not been seen at training time. This is a case of overfitting. The model is trying to model the idiosyncrasies of the training set (which can be noisy) finding a solution which will work only on the data at hand;\\nAn appropriate degree (center) will lead to a model with an appropriate capacity. The empirical risk is minimized and the solution also works with unseen data.  \\nNote that this is another instance of the bias-variance tradeoff. Complex models (right) have a large variance and a large bias: small variations of the training set are modeled and can lead to wrong solutions. Models that are too simple (left) have a low variance, but can still have a large bias (the model is too simple and the solution is not good). Choosing an appropriate capacity (in this case by choosing an appropriate polynomial degree) leads to a good trade-off between variance and bias.  \\nRegularization and Bias-Variance tradeoff In practice, there are different ways to reduce the model capacity. In the example above, the degree of the polynomial has been used as an hyperparameter to reduce the capacity of the model. A different approach would be to use regularization techniques. The plot below shows the result of fitting a polynomial regressor on the same data when Ridge regression is used:  \\nNote that even a polynomial of degree equal to 50 (right) achieves reasonable results now.', 'As previously mentioned, some binary classifiers output a probability or a confidence score and allow to obtain class predictions by thresholding on such probabilities or scores. When the confidence value is not a probability, it might not be easy to interpret it and find a good threshold. Even when the classifier outputs a probability, the optimal threshold might not be 0.5. For instance, we may want to build an intrusion detection system which is more or less sensitive to potential intrusions.  \\nThe ROC curve allows to evaluate the performance of a classifier independently  \\nfrom the threshold. Specifically, let  \\n$$\\nc(\\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$  \\nbe a function predicting a confidence value from an input vector $\\\\mathbf{x}$ . For instance, in the case of the logistic regressor:  \\n$$\\nc(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\sigma(\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\\\ldots+\\\\beta_{n}x_{n})\\n$$  \\nWe will define our classification function as:  \\n$$\\nh_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x})=[\\\\sigma(\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\\\ldots+\\\\beta_{n}x_{n})\\\\geq\\\\theta]\\n$$  \\nwhere $[\\\\cdot]$ denotes the Iverson brackets and $\\\\theta\\\\in{\\\\mathfrak{R}}$ is a real-valued threshold.  \\nDepending on the chosen value of the threshold, we will have a given number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives:  \\nWe will define the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) as follows:  \\n$$\\nT P R_{\\\\theta}=\\\\frac{T P_{\\\\theta}}{T P_{\\\\theta}+F N_{\\\\theta}}\\n$$  \\n$$\\nF P R_{\\\\theta}=\\\\frac{F P_{\\\\theta}}{F P_{\\\\theta}+T N_{\\\\theta}}\\n$$  \\nIn practice:  \\nThe TPR is the fraction of true positives over all positive elements - this is the  \\nsame as the recall; The FPR on the contrary is the fraction of false positive predictions over all negative elements.  \\nWe note that:  \\nIf we pick low threshold values, both the TPR and the FPR will be equal to 1. Indeed, with a small enough threshold, all elements will be classified as positives and there will be no predicted negatives, so the TPR will be equal to 1. At the same time, the FPR will be 1 because we will have no true negatives; If we pick high threshold values, both the TPR and the TNR will be zero. Indeed, with a large enough threshold, all elements will be classified as negatives and there will be no positive predictions, so the TPR will be zero. At the same time, since all elements will be classified as negatives and there will be no false positive predictions, the FPR will be equal to 0;  \\nAn ROC curve is obtained by picking a threshold value $\\\\theta$ and plotting a 2D point $(T P R_{\\\\theta},T N R_{\\\\theta})$ . By varying the threshold $\\\\theta,$ we obtain a curve which tell us what is the trade-off between TPR and TNR regardless of the threshold.  \\nThe following plot show an example of an ROC curve for a binary classifier on the breast cancer dataset:  \\nWe know that the two points $(0,0)$ and (1, 1) belong to the curve. Ideally, starting from a low threshold (with ${\\\\mathsf{T P R}}{=}{\\\\mathsf{F P R}}{=}1.$ ), as we move the threshold up enough, we would expect the FPR to decrease (we are discarding false positives), while the TPR is still high (we are not discarding true positives). Hence the ideal curve should be a rectangular curve touching point $(0,1)$ . In practice, we can measure the area under the ROC curve to see how well the classifier is doing. This value is generally referred to as “AUC”.  \\nThe dashed line indicates the performance of a random predictor. Note the the area under the curve identified by this dashed line will be equal to 0.5. Any curve which is systematically below this line indicates a classifier which is doing thresholding in the wrong way (i.e. we should invert the sign of the thresholding). For instance, this is the curve of the same classifier when we invert the sign of thresholding:  \\nWe can use ROC curves to compare two different classifiers as shown in the following:']\n",

The original logistic function was proposed by Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst in 1838 to model the problem of population growth, which can be formulated as follows:  \\nWe want to model the growth of a population $P(t)$ as time $t$ passes, under the assumption that resources are limited so that the population can reach at most the carrying capacity $K$ .  \\nVerhulst tried to model the growth with a linear ODE, i.e., trying to give an analytical formulation for the derivative of the population size $P(t)$ with respect to time $t$ . If resources were unlimited, we could model:  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d P(t)}{d t}=r P\\n$$  \\nwhere $r$ is an unknown growth coefficient. The expression above reflects the fact that, as population grows, it grows faster and faster. The derivative will change with time as follows:  \\nAs we know that resources are limited, however, we have to assume that the growth rate will at first increase, when many resources are available and population grows, then decrease. Verhulst hence revised the ODE as follows:  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d P(t)}{d t}=r P(1-\\\\frac{P}{K})\\n$$  \\nwhere $K$ is the carrying capacity. In practice, as $P$ approaches $K,$ the growth rate will slow down, as shown in the following:  \\nRate of Change of Population as a Function of Population Size  \\nTo obtain the size of population $P$ for varying $t,$ we can solve the ODE above, obtaining the following expression:  \\n$$\\nP=\\\\frac{K}{1+(\\\\frac{K-P_{0}}{P_{0}})e^{-r t}}\\n$$  \\nFrom here, it can be shown that we can obtain the standard logistic function:  \\n$$\\nf(t)={\\\\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}}\\n$$', 'The Gaussian distribution assumes that the probability of an observation deviating from the mean decreases exponentially as the square of the deviation. For some types of data, this assumption is not accurate: in some cases, deviating from the mean is much more likely than prescribed by the Gaussian model. An alternative mathematical model, introduced by Laplace, posits that the probability of an observation deviating from the mean decreases exponentially with the absolute value of the deviation:  \\n$$\\nL(x,M,b)={\\\\frac{1}{2b}}e^{-{\\\\frac{|x-M|}{b}}}\\n$$  \\nWhere $M$ represents the central/mean value of the distribution, and b is a scaling parameter known as diversity. It should be noted that due to the absolute value involved, this function is not differentiable at the mean value.  \\nThe best fit of this function to the data occurs when M is chosen as the median of the data, and b is chosen as the mean of the absolute differences between the data points and the median:  \\n$$\\nM=m e d i a n(\\\\{x_{i}\\\\}_{i=1}^{n})\\n$$  \\n$$\\nb={\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-M|}{n}}\\n$$  \\nIn this model, values far from the central value occur more frequently than they would in a Gaussian model.

It is a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the relationships between variables. At its core, linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (the one you want to predict) and one or more independent variables (the ones used for prediction).

The most commonly used is the gradient descent algorithm, which requires the cost function to be differentiable. We will not see this algorithm in details, but an introduction to it and its application to the estimation of the parameters of a logistic regressor are given in the following (hidden) section.', 'The logistic regressor is a parametric model: its performance depends on the accurate choice of its parameters.  \\nAs seen in the case of density estimation methods, parametric models have the advantage to be compact, but they make assumptions on the data. For instance, the logistic regressor assumes that data is linearly separable. A different approach to classification consists in the use of non-parametric models, which use the dataset as a support to make their predictions making very few assumptions on the nature of the data.  \\nThe most popular non-parametric classification model is certainly the nearest neighbor algorithm, which is introduced in this section.', 'We can estimate the paramters of the multinomial logistic regressor model again by maximizing the likelihood of the model on the data. Assuming that all observations are i.i.d., we can write:  \\n$$\\nL(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta})=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(Y=y^{(i)}|X=\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)};\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta})\\n$$  \\nAgain, we minimize the negative log likelihood:  \\n$$\\nn l(\\\\beta)=-\\\\log L(\\\\beta)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\log P(Y=y^{(i)}|X=\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)};\\\\beta)=\\n$$  \\n$$\\ny^{(i)}\\\\neq1)+y^{(i)}=1 and one for specie $\\\\mathsf{s}{=}2$ (setosa). No coefficients have been estimated for virginica , because it has been chosen as the baseline. We can see that all pvalues are small, so we can keep all variables. Let us see how to interpret the coefficients:  \\nThe intercept for $\\\\scriptstyle{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathsf{s p e c i e s}}}=1$ is 12.6771. This indicates that the odd of versicolor  versus virginica  is $e^{12.6771}=320327.76,$ when sepal_length  is set to zero. This is a very large number, probably due to the fact that sepal_lenght $=0$ is not a realistic observation.\\nThe intercept for $\\\\scriptstyle\\\\overbrace{\\\\ s{\\\\mathsf{p e c i e s}}=2}$ is 38.7590. This indicates that the odd of setosa  versus virginica  is $e^{38.7590}=6.8e+16,$ when sepal_length  is set to zero. Also in this case, we obtain a very large number, probably due to the fact that sepal_lenght $=0$ is not a realistic observation.\\nThe coefficient $-2.0307$ of sepal_length  for $\\\\scriptstyle\\\\overbrace{\\\\mathsf{s p e c i e s}=1}$ indicates that when we observe an increase in one centimeter of sepal_length , the odd of versicolor  versus virginica  decreases multiplicatively by $e^{-2.0307}=0.13$ (a large $-87\\\\%!$ ).\\nThe coefficient −6.8564 of sepal_length  for $\\\\scriptstyle{\\\\overbrace{\\\\ s\\\\ p e c\\\\ i e s=2}}$ indicates that when we observe an increase in one centimeter of sepal_length , the odd of setosa  versus virginica  decreases multiplicatively by $e^{-6.8464}=0.001$ (a large $-99.9\\\\%!$ ).']\n",

In the general case of non-convex loss function, the algorithm may converge to a local minimum, which may represent a suboptimal solution. Nevertheless, when the number of parameters is very large, gradient descent usually finds a good enough solution, even if it only converges to a local minimum.', 'Given the cost function $J(\\\\beta)$ above, we want to find suitable values $\\\\beta$ by solving the following optimization problem:  \\n$$\\n\\\\beta=\\\\arg_{\\\\beta}\\\\operatorname*{min}J(\\\\beta)\\n$$  \\nAs we already discussed, since $J$ is nonlinear, we cannot find a closed form solution for the estimation of the parameters.  \\nAlternatively, we could compute $\\\\mathbf{J}\\\\left({\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}\\\\right)$ for all possible values of $\\\\beta$ and choose the values of $\\\\beta$ which minimizes the cost. However, this option is unfeasible in practice as $\\\\beta$ may assume an infinite number of values. Hence, we need a way to find the values of $\\\\beta$ which minimize $\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\beta)$ without computing $\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\beta)$ for all possible values of $\\\\beta$ .  \\nIn these cases, we can use gradient descent, a numerical optimization strategy which allows to minimize differentiable functions with respect to their parameters.  \\nWe will introduce the gradient descent algorithm considering initially the problem of minimizing a function of a single variable $J(\\\\theta)$ .

Consider the function $J(\\\\theta)$ shown in the plot below:  \\nLet us assume that we are at the initial point $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta^{(0)}}$ . From the plot, we can see that we should move to the right part of the $\\\\mathsf{x}$ axis in order to reach the minimum of the function.  \\nThe first derivative of the function in that point $J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\beta^{(0)})$ will be equal to the angular coefficient of the tangent to the curve in the point $(\\\\theta^{(0)},J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{(0)}\\\\right))$ . Since the curve is decreasing in a neighborhood of $\\\\beta^{(0)}$ , the tangent line will also be decreasing. Therefore, its angular coefficient $J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(0)})$ will be negative. If we want to move to the right, we should follow in the inverse direction of the derivative of the curve in that point.  \\nThe gradient descent is an iterative algorithm; hence we are not trying to reach the minimum of the function in one step. Instead, we would like to move to another point $\\\\theta^{(1)}$ such that $J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{(1)}\\\\right)<J(\\\\theta^{(0)})$ . If we can do this for every point, we can reach the minimum in a number of steps.  \\nAt each step, we will move proportionally to the value of the derivative. This is based on the observation that larger absolute values of the derivative indicate steeper curves. If we choose a multiplier factor $\\\\gamma,$ we will move to the point:  \\n$$\\n\\\\theta^{(1)}=\\\\theta^{(0)}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(0)})\\n$$  \\nFor instance, if we choose $\\\\gamma=0.02,$ we will move to point $\\\\theta^{(1)}=0.4+0.02\\\\cdot1.8=0.436.$ . The procedure works iteratively until the derivative is so small that no movement is possible, as shown in the following figure:  \\nIn the next step, we compute the derivative of the function in the current point $J\\\\left(\\\\beta^{(1)}\\\\right)=-0.8$ and move to point $\\\\beta^{(2)}=\\\\beta_{1}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\beta^{(1)})$ .  \\nNext, we compute the derivative of the function in the current point  \\n$f\\\\left(\\\\theta^{\\\\left(2\\\\right)}\\\\right)=-0.4$ and move to point $\\\\theta^{(3)}=\\\\theta^{(2)}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(2)})$ :  \\nWe then compute the derivative of the current point $J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{\\\\left(3\\\\right)}\\\\right)\\\\approx0$ :  \\nThis derivative is so small that we cannot advance further. We are in a local minimum. The optimization terminates here. We have found the value $\\\\theta^{(3)}=\\\\arg_{\\\\theta}\\\\operatorname*{min}J(\\\\theta).$ .  \\nIn practice, the algorithm is terminated following a given termination criterion. Two common criteria are:  \\nA maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nThe value $\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta)$ is below a given threshold.', 'Similarly to polynomial regression, we need to find a transformation of the formulation of the linear regressor to transform its output into a nonlinear function of the independent variables. Of course, we do not want any transformation, but one that has the previously highlighted properties.  \\nIn practice the logistic function has some nice properties that, as we will se in a moment, allow to easily interpret the resulting model in a probabilistic way. The logistic function is defined as:  \\n$$\\nf(x)={\\\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}}\\n$$  \\nand has the following shape:  \\nAs we can see, the function has the properties we need:  \\nIts values are comprised between 0 and 1;\\nIt saturates to 0 and 1 for extreme values of $x$ .  \\nAdditionally, it is differentiable, which will be useful for optimization later.']\n",

However, this option is unfeasible in practice as $\\\\beta$ may assume an infinite number of values.

Consider the function $J(\\\\theta)$ shown in the plot below:  \\nLet us assume that we are at the initial point $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta^{(0)}}$ . From the plot, we can see that we should move to the right part of the $\\\\mathsf{x}$ axis in order to reach the minimum of the function.  \\nThe first derivative of the function in that point $J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\beta^{(0)})$ will be equal to the angular coefficient of the tangent to the curve in the point $(\\\\theta^{(0)},J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{(0)}\\\\right))$ . Since the curve is decreasing in a neighborhood of $\\\\beta^{(0)}$ , the tangent line will also be decreasing. Therefore, its angular coefficient $J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(0)})$ will be negative. If we want to move to the right, we should follow in the inverse direction of the derivative of the curve in that point.  \\nThe gradient descent is an iterative algorithm; hence we are not trying to reach the minimum of the function in one step.

If we can do this for every point, we can reach the minimum in a number of steps.  \\nAt each step, we will move proportionally to the value of the derivative.

The procedure works iteratively until the derivative is so small that no movement is possible, as shown in the following figure:  \\nIn the next step, we compute the derivative of the function in the current point $J\\\\left(\\\\beta^{(1)}\\\\right)=-0.8$ and move to point $\\\\beta^{(2)}=\\\\beta_{1}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\beta^{(1)})$ .  \\nNext, we compute the derivative of the function in the current point  \\n$f\\\\left(\\\\theta^{\\\\left(2\\\\right)}\\\\right)=-0.4$ and move to point $\\\\theta^{(3)}=\\\\theta^{(2)}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(2)})$ :  \\nWe then compute the derivative of the current point $J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{\\\\left(3\\\\right)}\\\\right)\\\\approx0$ :  \\nThis derivative is so small that we cannot advance further.

References  \\nLinear regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical technique in data analysis and machine learning. It is a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the relationships between variables. At its core, linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (the one you want to predict) and one or more independent variables (the ones used for prediction). This technique allows us to make predictions, infer associations, and gain insights into how changes in independent variables influence the target variable. Linear regression is both intuitive and versatile, making it a valuable tool for tasks ranging from simple trend analysis to more complex predictive modeling and hypothesis testing.  \\nIn this context, we will explore the concepts and applications of linear regression, its different types, and how to implement it using Python.', 'As an example of the application of Fisher’s Linear Discriminant, let us consider Fisher’s Iris dataset.

      "  - retrieval context: ['Softmax regression is an alternative formulation of multinomial logistic regression which is designed to avoid the definition of a baseline and it is hence symmetrical. In a softmax regressor, the probabilities are modeled as follows:  \\n$$\\nP(Y=k|X=\\\\mathbf{x})={\\\\frac{e^{{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\bf_{k}}}}}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}}}{\\\\sum_{l=1}^{K}\\\\mathbf{e^{{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{r}}}}\\\\mathbf{X}}}}},\\\\quad\\\\forall k=1,\\\\ldots,K\\n$$  \\nSo, rather than estimating $K-1$ coefficients, we estimate $K$ coefficients.  \\nThe optimization of the model is performed defining a similar cost function and optimizing it with iterative methods.  \\nThe softmax formulation is widely used in predictive analysis and machine learning, but less pervasive in statistics.', 'Often we need more than 2 classes • Positive/negative/neutral • Parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, etc.) • Classify emergency SMSs into different actionable classes  \\n• If $>2$ classes we use multinomial logistic regression = Softmax regression = Multinomial logit = (defunct names : Maximum entropy modeling or MaxE • So \"logistic regression\" will just mean binary (2 output classes)  \\n• The probability of everything must still sum to 1  \\nP(positive|doc) + P(negative|doc) + P(neutral|doc) = 1 • Need a generalization of the sigmoid called the softmax • Takes a vector $z=[z1,z2,...,z k]$ of k arbitrary values • Outputs a probability distribution each value in the range [0,1] • all the values summing to 1', 'When the dependent variable can assume more than two values, we can define the multinomial logistic regression model. In this case, we select one of the values of the dependent variable $Y$ as a baseline class. Without loss of generality, let $K$ be the number of classes and let $Y=1$ be the baseline class. Recall that in the case of the logistic regressor, we modeled the logarithm of the odd as our linear function:  \\n$$\\n\\\\log\\\\left({\\\\frac{P(y=1|\\\\mathbf{x})}{1-P(y=1|\\\\mathbf{x})}}\\\\right)=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}x_{1}+...+\\\\beta_{n}x_{n}\\n$$  \\nSince we have more than one possible outcomes for the dependent variable, rather than modeling the odds, a multinomial logistic regressor models the logarithm of the ratio between a given class $k$ and the baseline class 1 as follows:  \\n$$\\n\\\\log\\\\left({\\\\frac{P(Y=k|X=\\\\mathbf{x})}{P(Y=1|X=\\\\mathbf{x})}}\\\\right)=\\\\beta_{k0}+\\\\beta_{k1}x_{1}+...+\\\\beta_{k n}x_{n}\\n$$  \\nNote that, in practice, we need to define a different linear function for each class $k=1\\\\ldots K,$ hence we need $(n+1)\\\\times(k-1)$ parameters.  \\nDoing the math, it can be shown that:  \\n$$\\nP(Y=k|X=\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\frac{e^{\\\\beta_{\\\\mathbf{k}}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}}}{1+\\\\sum_{l=2}^{K}\\\\mathbf{e^{\\\\beta_{l}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}}}}\\n$$  \\n$$\\nP(Y=1|X=\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\sum_{l=2}^{K}\\\\mathbf{e}^{\\\\beta_{1}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\mathbf{X}}}\\n$$  \\nWhere $\\\\beta_{\\\\mathbf{k}}=(\\\\beta_{0},\\\\beta_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\beta_{k})$ and $\\\\mathbf{X}=(1,x_{1},\\\\ldots,x_{n})$ .  \\nThese two expressions can be used to compute the probabilities of the classes once that the parameters have been estimated and $x$ is observed.', 'Similarly, we can see the multinomial regressor as a multi-class classifier, i.e., a classifies with a number of classes larger than 2.

However, this option is unfeasible in practice as $\\\\beta$ may assume an infinite number of values.

From the plot, we can see that we should move to the right part of the $\\\\mathsf{x}$ axis in order to reach the minimum of the function.  \\nThe first derivative of the function in that point $J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\beta^{(0)})$ will be equal to the angular coefficient of the tangent to the curve in the point $(\\\\theta^{(0)},J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{(0)}\\\\right))$ . Since the curve is decreasing in a neighborhood of $\\\\beta^{(0)}$ , the tangent line will also be decreasing. Therefore, its angular coefficient $J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(0)})$ will be negative. If we want to move to the right, we should follow in the inverse direction of the derivative of the curve in that point.  \\nThe gradient descent is an iterative algorithm; hence we are not trying to reach the minimum of the function in one step.

If we can do this for every point, we can reach the minimum in a number of steps.  \\nAt each step, we will move proportionally to the value of the derivative.

The procedure works iteratively until the derivative is so small that no movement is possible, as shown in the following figure:  \\nIn the next step, we compute the derivative of the function in the current point $J\\\\left(\\\\beta^{(1)}\\\\right)=-0.8$ and move to point $\\\\beta^{(2)}=\\\\beta_{1}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\beta^{(1)})$ .  \\nNext, we compute the derivative of the function in the current point  \\n$f\\\\left(\\\\theta^{\\\\left(2\\\\right)}\\\\right)=-0.4$ and move to point $\\\\theta^{(3)}=\\\\theta^{(2)}-\\\\gamma J^{\\\\prime}(\\\\theta^{(2)})$ :  \\nWe then compute the derivative of the current point $J\\\\left(\\\\theta^{\\\\left(3\\\\right)}\\\\right)\\\\approx0$ :  \\nThis derivative is so small that we cannot advance further. We are in a local minimum. The optimization terminates here.

This will effectively remove collinearity and solve the instability issues of linear regression. However, when there is a large number of predictors, this approach may not be very convenient. Also, it is not always clear which predictors to remove and which ones to keep, especially in the case of multicollinearity (sets of more than two variables which are highly correlated).  \\nA “soft approach” would be to feed all variables to the model and encourage it to set some of the coefficients to zero. If we could do this, the model would effectively select which variables to exclude from the model, hence releasing us from making a hard decision.  \\nThis can be done by changing our cost function, the RSS. Recall that the RSS of linear regression (Ordinary Least Squares) can be written as:  \\n$$\\nR S S=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y_{i}-\\\\beta_{0}-\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta_{j}x_{i j})^{2}\\n$$  \\nwhere $\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{i j}$ is the value of the $x_{j}$ variable in the $i^{t h}$ observation.  \\nWe can write the cost function as follows:  \\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y_{i}-\\\\beta_{0}-\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta_{j}x_{i j})^{2}+\\\\lambda\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta_{j}^{2}=R S S+\\\\lambda\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta_{j}^{2}\\n$$  \\nIn practice, we are adding the following term:  \\n$$\\n\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\\\beta_{j}^{2}\\n$$  \\nweighted by a parameter $\\\\lambda$ . The term above penalizes solutions with large values for the coefficients $\\\\beta_{j},$ hence encouraging the model to put some of the variables to zero, or close to zero. This term is called “regularization term” and a linear regressor fit by minimizing this new cost function is called a ridge regressor.  \\nThe cost function has a parameter $\\\\lambda$ which must be set as a constant. These kinds of parameters which we need to specify manually and are not computed from the data, are called hyperparameters. In practice, $\\\\lambda$ controls how much we want to regularize the linear regressor. The higher the value of $\\\\lambda,$ the stronger the regularization will be, hence encouraging the model to select small values of $\\\\beta_{j}$ or set some of them to zero.  \\nTo avoid $\\\\lambda$ having different effects depending on the unit measures of the given variables, it is common to z-score all variables before computing a ridge regressor.  \\nThis is shown in the following plot, which shows the values of the parameters $\\\\beta_{j}$ when a ridge regression model is fit with different values of $\\\\lambda$ :  \\nAs can be seen, the coefficient values are gradually shrunk towards zero as the value of $\\\\lambda$ increases. Interestingly, the model “decides” which coefficients to shrink. For instance, for low values of $\\\\lambda,$ weight  is shrunk, while acceleration  is first shrunk, then allowed to be larger than zero. This is due to the fact that, the regularization term acts as a sort of “soft constraint” encouraging the model to find smaller weights, while still finding a good solution.  \\nIt can be shown (but we will not see it formally), that ridge regression reduces the variance of coefficient estimates. At the same time, the bias is increased. So, finding a good value of $\\\\lambda$ allows to control the bias-variance trade-off.', 'Many algorithms have some parameters which are not explicitly part of the final model $h,$ but they need to be set in order to solve the optimization problem. For example, in a ridge or lasso regressor, the parameter $\\\\lambda$ is used to control the amount of regularization during the learning process, however, the final parameter is not part of the model and is not automatically found during the optimization process.  \\nHyperparameters are usually found using grid searches: we train models using different values of the hyperparamters and choose the model which performs best. However, caution should be taken when hyperparameters are selected with grid search.  \\nRecall that we are not allowed to make any choice on the final model using the test set. Indeed, if we did so, we may incur in a form of overfitting which we would not be able to measure. For instance, we can choose a given parameter which works well only for that specific test set. How can we be sure that performance will be good when new data is analyzed?  \\nTo avoid this problem, we should work with three different sets of data: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. We will use the training set to train the model, the validation set to choose the hyperparameters and the test set to test the final performance. This is done by training different models on the test set, choosing the hyperparamter values leading to best values on the validation set, and then retraining the model on the training set (or on the union of training and validation set) to final test on the test set.  \\nThe most common scheme is to use a fixed split with a $60:20:20$ ratio, as shown in the following:  \\nHowever, other combinations are possible. An approach which often used when the dataset is small is a follows:  \\nThe dataset is split into a training and test set;\\nHyperparameters are optimized using cross-validation on the training set - this consists in executing different cross-validations with different hyperparameter values - then the parameters achieving the best performance are chosen;\\nOnce the best hyperparameters are found, the model is re-trained on the full training set and tested on the test set.  \\nThis is illustrated in the following figure:  \\nAgain, if the dataset is large enough and the training procedure is computationally expensive, it is common to use a fixed split as illustrated above.  \\nThe scikit-learn  library allows to easily perform hyperparameter search using cross-validation for different algorithms.  \\nMore in general, these techniques can be used to compare different models and select the best performing one.']\n",

The last subplot compares the different estimated lines with the population regression line and the average regression line (in red). Coefficient estimates are shown in the subplot titles.  \\nAs can be noted, each estimate can be inaccurate, while the average regression line is very close to the population regression line. This is due to the fact that our estimators for the parameters of the regression coefficients have non-zero variance. In practice, in can be shown that these estimators are unbiased (hence the average regression line is close to the population line).', 'To fit the model and find suitable values for the $\\\\beta_{\\\\mathbf{i}}$ parameters, we will define a cost function, similarly to what we have done in the case of linear regression.  \\nEven if we can see the logistic regression problem as the linear regression problem of fitting the $l o g i t(p)=\\\\beta^{T}\\\\mathbf{x}$ function, differently from linear regression, we should note that we do not have the ground truth probabilities p.

Similarly, if $y=0,$ the first factor is equal to 1 and the expression reduces to $1-f_{\\\\beta}(x)$ .  \\nWe can estimate the parameters by maximum likelihood, i.e., choosing the values of the parameters which maximize the probability of the data under the model identified by the parameters $\\\\beta$ :  \\n$$\\nL\\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\right)=P(Y|X;\\\\beta)\\n$$  \\nIf we assume that the training examples are all independent, the likelihood can be expressed as:  \\n$$\\nL\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}\\\\right)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(y^{(i)}|\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)};\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta})=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{N}f_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)^{y^{(i)}}\\\\left(1-f_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\right)^{1-y^{(i)}}\\n$$  \\nMaximizing this expression is equivalent to minimizing the negative logarithm of $L(\\\\beta)$ (negative log-likelihood - nll):  \\n$$\\n\\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\right)=-\\\\log L\\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\right)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\log\\\\left[f_{\\\\beta}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)^{y^{(i)}}\\\\left(1-f_{\\\\beta}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\right)^{1-y^{(i)}}\\\\right]=\\n$$  \\n$$\\n=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\left[y^{(i)}\\\\log f_{\\\\beta}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)+\\\\left(1-y^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\left(1-f_{\\\\beta}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right]\\n$$  \\nHence, we will define our cost function as:  \\n$$\\nJ\\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\right)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\left[y^{(i)}\\\\log f_{\\\\beta}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)+\\\\left(1-y^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\left(1-f_{\\\\beta}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right]\\n$$  \\nThis can be rewritten more explicitly in terms of the $\\\\beta$ parameters as follows:  \\n$$\\nJ\\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\right)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\left[y^{(i)}\\\\log\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\beta^{T}\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)+\\\\left(1-y^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\left(1-\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\beta^{T}\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right.\\n$$  \\nSimilarly to linear regression, we now have a cost function to minimize in order to find the values of the $\\\\beta_{i}$ parameters. Unfortunately, in this case, $J(\\\\beta)$ assumes a nonlinear form which prevents us to use the least square principles and there is no closed form solution for the parameter estimation. In these cases, parameters can be estimated using some form of iterative solver, which begins with an initial guess for the parameters and iteratively refine them to find the final solution. Luckily, the logistic regression cost function is convex, and hence only a single solution is admitted, independently from the initial guess.  \\nDifferent iterative solvers can be used in practice. The most commonly used is the gradient descent algorithm, which requires the cost function to be differentiable. We will not see this algorithm in details, but an introduction to it and its application to the estimation of the parameters of a logistic regressor are given in the following (hidden) section.', 'The multiple regression model based on two variable has a geometrical interpretation. Indeed, the equation:  \\n$$\\nZ=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}X+\\\\beta_{2}Y\\n$$  \\nidentifies a plane in the 3D space. We can visualize the plane identified by the mpg = β0 + β1horsepower $+\\\\beta_{2}$ weight model as follows:  \\nThe dashed lines indicate the residuals. The best fit of the model minimizes again the sum of squared residuals. This model makes predictions selecting the $Z$ value which intersect the plane for given values of $X$ and $Y$ .  \\nIn general, when we consider $n$ variables, the linear regressor will be a (n-1)- dimensional hyperplane in the n-dimensional space.', 'Simple linear regression aims to model the linear relationship between two variables $X$ and $Y$ . In our example dataset, we will consider $X=$ horsepower and $Y={\\\\mathrm{mpg}}$ .  \\nSince we are trying to model a linear relationship, we can imagine a line passing through the data. The simple linear regression model is defined as:  \\n$$\\nY\\\\approx\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}X\\n$$  \\nIn our example:  \\n$$\\n{\\\\mathrm{mpg}}\\\\approx\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}{\\\\mathrm{horsepower}}\\n$$  \\nIt is often common to introduce a “noise” variable which captures the randomness due to which the expression above is approximated and write:  \\n$$\\nY=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}X+\\\\epsilon\\n$$  \\nAs we will see later, we expect $\\\\epsilon$ to be small and randomly distributed.  \\nGiven the model above, we will call:  \\n· $X,$ the independent variable or regressor;\\n· $\\\\smash{\\\\ensuremath{Y_{\\\\perp}}}$ the dependent variable or regressed variable.  \\nThe values $\\\\beta_{0}$ and $\\\\beta_{1}$ are called coefficients or parameters of the model.  \\nThe mathematical model above has a geometrical interpretation.

In the case of our example, we expect the geometrical model to have this aspect:  \\nThis line will also be called the regression line.']\n",

References  \\nLinear regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical technique in data analysis and machine learning. It is a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the relationships between variables. At its core, linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (the one you want to predict) and one or more independent variables (the ones used for prediction). This technique allows us to make predictions, infer associations, and gain insights into how changes in independent variables influence the target variable. Linear regression is both intuitive and versatile, making it a valuable tool for tasks ranging from simple trend analysis to more complex predictive modeling and hypothesis testing.  \\nIn this context, we will explore the concepts and applications of linear regression, its different types, and how to implement it using Python.', 'The statistical interpretation of a multiple linear regression model is very similar to the interpretation of a simple linear regression model. Given the general model:  \\n$$\\ny=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}x_{1}+...+\\\\beta_{i}x_{i}+...+\\\\beta_{n}x_{n}\\n$$  \\nwe can interpret the coefficients as follows:  \\nThe value of $\\\\beta_{0}$ indicates the value of $y$ when all independent variables are set to zero; The value of $\\\\beta_{i}$ indicates the increment of $y$ that we expect to see when $\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ increments by one unit, provided that all other values $\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{j}|j\\\\neq i$ are constant.  \\nIn the considered example:  \\n$$\\nm p g=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}h o r s e p o w e r+\\\\beta_{2}w e i g h t\\n$$  \\nwe obtain the following estimates for the coefficients:  \\n<html><body><table><tr><td>B</td><td>B2</td></tr><tr><td>45.64 -0.05</td><td>-0.01</td></tr></table></body></html>  \\nWe can interpret these estimates as follows:  \\nCars with zero horsepower  and zero weight  will have an mpg  of 45.64 ( $\\\\approx19.4K m/l)$ .\\nAn increment of one unit of horsepower  is associated to a decrement of mpg of $-0.05$ units, provided that weight  is constant. This makes sense: cars with more horsepower  will probably consume more fuel.\\nAn increment of one unit of weight  is associated to a decrement of mpg  of -0.01  units, provided that horsepower  is constant. This makes sense: heavier cars will consume more fuel.  \\nLet’s compare the estimates above with the estimates of our previous model:  \\n$$\\nm p g=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}h o r s e p o w e r\\n$$  \\nIn that case, we obtained:  \\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>β1</td></tr><tr><td>39.94</td><td>-0.16</td></tr></table></body></html>  \\nWe can note that the coefficients are different. This happens because, when we add more variables, the model explains variance in a different way. If we think more about it, this is coherent with the interpretation of the coefficients. Indeed:  \\n39.94 is the expected value of mpg  when $\\\\scriptstyle\\\\left({\\\\textsf{h o r s e p o w e r}}=0\\\\right)$ but all other variables have unknown values. 45.64 is the expected value of mpg  when horsepower $=0$ and weight $=0$ . This is different, as in the second case we are (virtually) looking at a subset of data for which both horsepower and weight are zero, while in the first case, we are only looking at data for which horsepower $\\\\scriptstyle=0$ , but weight  can be any value. In some sense, we can see 39.94 as an average value for different values of weight  (and all other unobserved variables).  \\n· $-0.16$ is the expected increment of mpg  when we observe an increment of one unit of horsepower  and we don’t know anything about the values of the other variables. $-0.05$ is the expected increment of mpg  when horsepower and weight  are held constant, so, again, we are (virtually) looking at a different subset of the data in which the relationship between mpg  and horsepower  may be a bit different.  \\nNote that, also in the case of multiple regression, we can estimate confidence intervals and perform statistical tests. In our example, we will get this table:  \\n<html><body><table><tr><td>COEFFICIENT</td><td>STD ERROR t</td><td>P>|tl</td><td>CONFIDENCEINTERVAL</td></tr><tr><td>β 45.64</td><td>0.793 57.54</td><td>0</td><td>[44.08, 47.20]</td></tr><tr><td>β1 -0.05</td><td>0.011 -4.26</td><td>0</td><td>[-0.07,-0.03]</td></tr><tr><td>β2 -0.01</td><td>0.001</td><td>-11.53 0</td><td>[-0.007,-0.005]</td></tr></table></body></html>']\n",

Indeed, to interpret it, we had to check the range of the $Y$ values. An alternative way to check if the model is fitting the data well, would be to compare the performance of our model with the performance of a baseline model which assumes no association between the $X$ and $Y$ variables. This model would be:  \\n$$\\nY=k\\n$$  \\nThis model has a single parameter $k$ . The Residual Sum of Squares of this model would be:  \\n$$\\nR S S(k)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(k-y_{i})^{2}}\\n$$  \\nTo find the optimal value $k,$ we can compute the derivative of the RSS and set it to zero:  \\n$$\\n{\\\\frac{\\\\partial R S S(k)}{\\\\partial k}}=2\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(k-y_{i}\\\\right)=2(n k-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i})=2(n k-n\\\\overline{{y}})\\n$$  \\n$$\\n2n(k-\\\\overline{{y}}_{i})=0\\\\Leftrightarrow k=\\\\overline{{y}}_{i}\\n$$  \\nHence, the optimal estimator, when there is not relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is the average value of $Y$ . We will call its RSS value the total sum of squares:  \\n$$\\nT S S=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-{\\\\overline{{y}}})^{2}\\n$$  \\nWe can compare the RSS value obtained by our model to the TSS, which is the error of the baseline method:  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{R S S}{T S S}\\n$$  \\nThis number will be comprised between 0 and 1, and in particular:  \\n$\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\frac{R S S}{T S S}=0}\\\\end{array}$ when $R S S=0,$ i.e., we have a perfect model; $\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\frac{R S S}{T S S}=1}\\\\end{array}$ when $R S S=T S S,$ i.e., we are not doing any better than the baseline model (so our model is poor).  \\nNote that the RSS measures the variability in $Y$ left unexplained after regression (the one that the model could not capture), while the TSS measures the total variability in $Y$ . The fraction hence explains the proportion of variability which the model could not explain.  \\nWe define the $R^{2}$ statistic as:  \\n$$\\nR^{2}=1-\\\\frac{R S S}{T S S}\\n$$  \\nInverting by the $1-$ subtraction, this number measures the proportion of variability in $Y$ that can be explained using $X$  \\nThe plot below shows examples of linear regression fits with different $R^{2}$ values.  \\nThe interpretation of the $R^{2}$ is related to the one of the Pearson’s $\\\\rho$ correlation coefficient.

While we have already seen regression models as approaches to understand relationships within the data, in this context we are interested in defining good hypothesis functions $\\\\hat{h}$ able to predict continuous values $\\\\hat{y}$ from continuous inputs $x$ . We can see the defined hypothesis function $\\\\hat{h}$ as an approximation of the true function $f$ generating $y$ from $x\\\\colon y=f(x)$ . We will say that we are tackling a regression problem whenever the hypothesis function takes the form:  \\n$$\\nh:\\\\Re^{n}\\\\rightarrow\\\\Re^{m}\\n$$  \\nNote that we have seen the case in which $n=m=1$ (simple regression) and the case in which $n>1,m=1$ (multiple regression). When both $n>1,m>1,$ both the inputs and outputs of the regression model will be vectors of continuous values. We will see how linear regression models can be easily generalized to work in this case as well, but for the moment we will consider the form above as the general form of a regression model.', 'Of course, we would like to quantify this relationship in a more formal way. As in the case of a linear regressor, we want to define a model which can predict the independent variable $y$ from the dependent variables $x_{i}$ . If such model gives good predictions, than we can trust its interpretation as a means of studying the relationship between the variables.  \\nWe can think of converting $\\\\boxed{\\\\ B\\\\ =>\\\\ 1}$ and $\\\\boxed{\\\\mathsf{M}\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\vartheta}},$ and then compute a linear regressor:  \\n$$\\nD i a g n o s i s=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}r a d i u s1\\n$$  \\nThis would be the result:  \\nWe can immediately see that this function does not model the relationship between the two variables very well. While we obtain a statistically relevant regressor with $R^{2}=0.533$ and statistically relevant coefficients, the residual plot will look like this:  \\nThe correlation between the residuals and the independent variable is a strong indication that the true relationship between the two variables is not correcly modeled. After all, from a purely predictive point of view, we are using a linear regressor which takes the form:  \\n$$\\nf:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}\\n$$  \\nwhile the values Diagnosis  variable belong to the set $\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ and we would need instead a function with the following form:  \\n$$\\nf:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\n$$  \\nHowever, the linear regressor cannot directly predict discrete values.  \\nIn practice, while with a linear regressor we wanted to predict continuous values, now we want to assign observations $\\\\mathbf{x}$ to discrete bins (in this case only two possible ones). As we will better study later in the course, this problem is known as classification.', 'Regression models, in general, aim to study the relationship between two variables, $X$ and $Y_{\\\\iota}$ , by defining a mathematical model $f$ such that:  \\n$$\\nY=f(X)+\\\\epsilon\\n$$  \\nHere:  \\n· $f$ is a deterministic function which can be used to predict the values of $Y$ from the values of $X$ ;\\n· $\\\\epsilon$ is an error term, i.e., a variable capturing everything that is not captured by the deterministic function $f$ . It can be due to different reasons, the main of which are: 。 $f$ is not an accurate deterministic function of the process. Since we don’t know the “true” function $f$ and we are only estimating it, we may obtain a suboptimal $f$ for which $Y\\\\neq f(X)$ . The error term captures the differences between our predictions and the true values. $Y$ cannot only be predicted from $X,$ but some other variable is needed to correctly predict $Y$ from $X$ . For instance, $X$ could be “years of education” and $Y$ can be “income”. While may expect that “income” is not completely predicted from “years of education”. This can happen also because we don’t always have observations for all relevant variables.  \\nthe problem has inherent stochasticity which cannot be entirely modeled within the deterministic function $f$ . For instance, consider the problem of predicting the rate of wins in poker based on the expertise of the player. The expertise surely allows to predict the rate of wins, but wins partially depend also on random factors, such as how the deck was shuffled.  \\nNote that, often, we model $f$ in a way that we have its analytical form. This is very powerful. If we have the analytical form of the function $f$ which explains how $Y$ is influenced from $X$ (can be predicted from $X$ ), then we can really understand deeply the connection between the two variables  \\nThe function $f$ can take different forms. The most common one is the linear form that we will see in the next section. While the linear form is very simple (and hence we can anticipate it will be a limited model in many cases), it has the great advantage to be easy to interpret.', 'We can see linear regression as a form of predictive modeling. Note that, when looking at the linear regressor as a predictive model, we are more interested in its accuracy than in its interpretability. In this context:  \\nWe will assume $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\Re^{n},\\\\mathcal{Y}=\\\\Re$ The hypothesis function will take the form:  \\n$$\\nh(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\beta_{0}+\\\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\\\ldots+\\\\beta_{n}x_{n}\\n$$  \\nWe will call our dataset the training set;  \\nWe will define our loss function as the error function:  \\n$$\\nL(h(x),y)=(h(x)-y)^{2};\\n$$  \\nIn this case the empirical risk is defined as follows:  \\n$$\\nR_{e m p}=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(h(x)-y)^{2}=\\\\frac{1}{N}R S S\\n$$  \\nNote that, since:  \\n$$\\n:\\\\arg\\\\operatorname*{min}_{h\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}}R_{e m p}(h)=\\\\arg\\\\operatorname*{min}_{h\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(h(x)-y)^{2}=\\\\underset{h\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\arg\\\\operatorname*{min}}\\\\frac{1}{N}R S_{\\\\delta}^{2}\\n$$  \\nwe can solve the optimization problem with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) (the same method we used previously to minimize RSS).  \\nFrom a learning perspective, solving the optimization problem $\\\\hat{h}=\\\\underset{h\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\arg\\\\operatorname*{min}}R_{e m p}(h)$ corresponds to finding the optimal set of parameters $\\\\beta$ minimizing the empirical risk, which corresponds to minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares, as previously defined.  \\nIt is worth to emphasize that we are now interested in minimizing the empirical risk as much as possible, even if the model loses interpretability. Hence, we can  \\nnormalize the data, use many variables, include interaction terms, use polynomial regression, regularize with lasso and ridge, as long as it improves the performance of the model.']\n",

Probabilistic discriminative models, in particular, do so by directly modeling the conditional probability distribution  \\n$$\\nP(Y=k|X=\\\\mathbf{x})\\n$$  \\nThis is for instance the case of a logistic regressor.  \\nGenerative models are another class of algorithms which do not explicitly model the conditional probability. Instead, they model the probability of the predictors independently for each class:  \\n$$\\nP(\\\\mathbf{x}|Y=k)\\n$$  \\nand then use the Bayes’ theorem to obtain the conditional probability and make predictions.  \\nDifferently from discriminative models, generative models make assumptions on the distribution of the data (e.g., data is often assumed to be Guassian) and hence are often less general than discriminative models. However, they can be  \\nadvantageous when the training data is scarce. Also, while discriminative models such as the logistic regressor are unstable when data is linearly separable, generative approaches do not suffer from this limitation.  \\nGenerative models are so called because, by modeling the distribution of the data, they provide a complete data model which may also be used to generate new data following the joint probability distribution  \\n$$\\nP(X,Y)\\n$$  \\neven if they are mainly used to perform classification in this context.', 'MAP is “maximum a posteriori” $\\\\mathbf{\\\\tau}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\tau}$ most likely class c∈C P(c | d)P(d) = argmax Bayes Rule c∈C P(d) = argmax P(d | c)P(c) Dropping the denominator c∈C\\n', '• A case of conditional maximum likelihood estimation  \\nWe choose the parameters w, $b$ that maximize  \\nthe log probability of the true y labels in the training data given the observations x', 'One may think that a model minimizing the empirical risk will be the best possible one. However, especially when the training set is not large enough (as compared to the complexity of the model) or not representative enough of the joint probability distribution $P(X,Y),$ , the estimation of the empirical risk may be limited. As an example, consider the following model:  \\n$$\\n\\\\hat{h}(x)=y\\\\mathrm{s.t.}(x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{TR}\\n$$  \\nThe hypothesis $\\\\hat{h}$ defined above will lead to an empirical risk equal to 0 as long as the loss function is defined in such a way that $L(y,y)=0$ . Indeed:  \\n$$\\nR_{e m p}(\\\\hat{h}(x))=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\\\cal L}(y,y)=0\\n$$  \\nHowever, the function above will not be defined for any value:  \\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{\\\\psi}_{x^{\\\\prime}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}_{\\\\textrm{s.t.}}(x^{\\\\prime},y)\\\\not\\\\in\\\\mathrm{~TR~}\\\\forall y\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Y}\\n$$  \\nSince we expect the training set to be a sample from the distribution $P(X,Y),$ we expect such values $x^{\\\\prime}$ to exist (otherwise the training is the population, which is in general not true).  \\nThe example above is an extreme case of a phenomenon called overfitting, which happens when a given hypothesis achieves a low error on the training set, but the solution is not general enough to obtain similar performance (i.e., a similar risk) on data not belonging to the training set.  \\nThe phenomenon of overfitting is often related to the capacity of the model. A model with a large capacity can represent very complex functions $h$ and result in overfitting, while a model is a small capacity can represent relatively simple functions $h,$ making overfitting harder, but possibly resulting in an underfitting model, i.e., a model which is too simple, and as a result cannot reach a low empirical risk.  \\nThis is best seen with the simple regression example below:  \\nThe example shows the fit of three polynomial regression models of different degrees (the first one is degree 1, which corresponds to a linear regressor). As can be noted:  \\nA lower degree polynomial (e.g., a line - left) will lead to underfitting. In this  \\ncase, the model is too simple to model the data well, so the empirical risk will be large;\\nA higher degree polynomial (right) will minimize the empirical risk but find a complex model which will not describe well data which has not been seen at training time. This is a case of overfitting. The model is trying to model the idiosyncrasies of the training set (which can be noisy) finding a solution which will work only on the data at hand;\\nAn appropriate degree (center) will lead to a model with an appropriate capacity. The empirical risk is minimized and the solution also works with unseen data.  \\nNote that this is another instance of the bias-variance tradeoff. Complex models (right) have a large variance and a large bias: small variations of the training set are modeled and can lead to wrong solutions. Models that are too simple (left) have a low variance, but can still have a large bias (the model is too simple and the solution is not good). Choosing an appropriate capacity (in this case by choosing an appropriate polynomial degree) leads to a good trade-off between variance and bias.  \\nRegularization and Bias-Variance tradeoff In practice, there are different ways to reduce the model capacity. In the example above, the degree of the polynomial has been used as an hyperparameter to reduce the capacity of the model. A different approach would be to use regularization techniques. The plot below shows the result of fitting a polynomial regressor on the same data when Ridge regression is used:  \\nNote that even a polynomial of degree equal to 50 (right) achieves reasonable results now.']\n",

This can be reasonably true when the representation space is ideal for the classification task and the data is clean and simple enough. For instance, we expect similar documents to have similar word frequencies.  \\nHowever, it is often common to have ‘outliers’ in the training data, i.e., data points which do not closely follow the distribution of the other data points. This can be due to different factors:  \\nThe data may not be clean: maybe an email has been wrongly classified as “spam” when it’s actually not spam;\\nThe data representation may not be ideal: there could be legitimate email in which the word “viagra” is used and there are many orthographical errors. Think of a legitimate email forwarding a spam email. Our simple representation does not account for that, which leads to outliers.  \\nLet us consider as an outlier a legitimate e-mail containing the word ‘viagra’. This example can be seen graphically as follows:  \\nLet us now assume that we are presented with a test example which is shown as a red cross in the following figure:  \\nIn the example above, the nearest neighbor algorithm would classify the test example (the red cross) as “non spam” since the closest point is the green outlier, while it is clear that the example is most probably a “spam” e-mail. Indeed, while the closest example is “non spam”, all other examples nearby belong to the “spam” class.  \\nReasonably, in cases like this, we should not look just at the closest point in space, but instead, we should look at a neighborhood of the data point. Consider the following example:  \\nIf we look at a sufficiently large neighborhood, we find that most of the points in the neighborhood are actually spam-spam one.  \\nIn practice, setting an appropriate radius for the neighborhood is not easy. For instance, if the space is not uniformly dense (and usually it is not – as in the example above$\\\\mathbf{K}$ is a hyper-parameter of the algorithm.  \\nSimilarly to what we have defined in the case of density estimation, given a point $\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime}$ , we will define the neighborhood of training points of size $K$ centered at $\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime}$ as follows:  \\n$$\\nN_{K}({\\\\bf x}^{\\\\prime})=N({\\\\bf x}^{\\\\prime},R_{K}({\\\\bf x}^{\\\\prime}))\\n$$  \\nwhere $N(x,r)$ denotes a neighborhood centered at $x$ and with radius $\\\\boldsymbol{r},$ and:  \\n$$\\nR_{K}(\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime})=\\\\operatorname*{sup}\\\\{r:|N(\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime},r)\\\\setminus\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime}\\\\}|\\\\leq K\\\\}\\n$$  \\nFinally, we define the K-Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm (also called KNN) as follows:  \\n$$\\nh\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)=m o d e\\\\{y|\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x},y\\\\right)\\\\in N\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime};T R,K\\\\right)\\\\}\\n$$  \\nWhere mode is the “statistical mode” function, which returns the most frequent element of a set.  \\nK is in practice an hyperparameter of the algorithm. It can be set to some arbitrary value or optimized using a validation set or cross-validation.  \\nWe should note that this definition generalizes the nearest neighbor algorithm defined before. Indeed, a 1-NN is exactly the nearest neighbor classifier seen above.', '• A model that perfectly match the training data has a problem.  \\nIt will also overfit to the data, modeling noise  \\n• A random word that perfectly predicts y (it happens to only occur in one class) will get a very high weight. • Failing to generalize to a test set without this word.  \\nA good model should be able to generalize  \\nThis movie drew me in, and it\\'ll do the same to you.  \\nI can\\'t tell you how much I hated this movie.

Depending on the application, we may want to have a higher precision or a higher recall. For example:  \\nConsider a spam detector: we may want to have a very high precision, even at the cost of a low recall. Indeed, we want to make sure that if we classify an e-mail as spam (and hence we filter it out), it is actually spam (hence a high precision). This is acceptable even if sometimes we let a spam email get through the filter (hence a low recall). Consider a medical pre-screening test which is used to assess if a patient is likely to have a given pathology. The test is cheap (e.g., a blood test) and can be made on a large sample of patients. If the test is positive, we then perform a more expensive but accurate test. In this case, we want to have a high recall. Indeed, if a patient has the pathology, we want to detect it and send the patient for the second, more accurate test (hence a high precision). This is acceptable even if sometimes we have false positives (hence a low precision). Indeed, if we wrongly detect a pathology, the second test will give the correct  \\nresult.  \\nPrecision and recall can often have contrasting values (e.g., we can obtain a high precision but a low recall and vice versa), hence it is generally necessary to look at both numbers together.']\n",

The analyst starts by defining the question that the data analysis needs to answer (step 1 - define your data analysis question): “What are the common themes and issues in customer reviews, and how can we address them to improve product quality and satisfaction?” To answer this question, the analyst collects a diverse dataset of customer reviews from various sources (step 2 - collect the data needed), including the company’s website, social media, and third-party review platforms.

This involves data preprocessing, such as removing punctuation and converting text to lowercase. After cleaning the data, the analyst explores and describes it (step 4 - explore and describe the data) using techniques like word clouds, frequency distributions, and sentiment analysis to uncover common words, sentiments, and trends within the reviews.  \\nTo extract more meaningful insights from the text data, the analyst decides to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques (step 5 - choose suitable models for analysis).

However, upon implementing LDA and reviewing the results, the analyst realizes that some topics are unclear and overlapping (step 6 - fit, fine-tune, evaluate, and compare the models).  \\nAcknowledging the need to revisit the analysis, the analyst decides to backtrack to the data exploration step (step 4 - explore and describe the data) to gain a deeper understanding of the customer feedback.

Armed with this insight, the analyst decides to categorize reviews into “product-related” and “service-related” (step 5 - choose suitable models for analysis) before applying topic modeling.  \\nWith the revised approach, the analyst proceeds to categorize reviews and then applies LDA separately to the two categories (step 6 - Fit, fine-tune, evaluate, and compare the models for the considered data analysis). This results in more interpretable topics, such as “defective products,” “timely shipping,” and “responsive customer support.” The analyst then analyzes these topics to generate actionable insights for product improvement and customer service enhancements.  \\nTo ensure continuous improvement, the analyst commits to ongoing review and monitoring (step 7 - Review the data analysis when new data is available) of customer reviews, periodically updating the analysis to identify new emerging issues or trends.

The number of neighbors changes the decision map:  \\nFor small values, the algorithm tends to over-segment the space and creates very small regions for isolated training data-points.  \\nFor larger values, the regions tend to be smoother and isolated data points are ignored.\\nChoosing a larger K can reduce overfitting (indeed the isolated data-points can be seen as outliers).\\nHowever, choosing a too large K can encourage underfitting, by completing ignoring some of the decision regions.\\nIn particular, setting K to the size of the training set, any data point is classified with the most numerous class.', 'Given:  \\nClassifier A and B\\nMetric M: M(A,x) is the performance of A on testset x $\\\\delta({\\\\sf x})$ : the performance difference between A, B on x: $\\\\delta({\\\\mathsf x})={\\\\mathsf M}({\\\\mathsf A},{\\\\mathsf x})-{\\\\mathsf M}({\\\\mathsf B},{\\\\mathsf x})$  \\n• We want to know if $\\\\delta({\\\\sf x})>0$ , meaning A is better than B $\\\\delta({\\\\sf x})$ is called the effect size  \\nSuppose we look and see that $\\\\delta({\\\\sf x})$ is positive. Are we done?  \\nNo', 'These values capture different properties of the classifier. Depending on the application, we may want to have a higher precision or a higher recall. For example:  \\nConsider a spam detector: we may want to have a very high precision, even at the cost of a low recall. Indeed, we want to make sure that if we classify an e-mail as spam (and hence we filter it out), it is actually spam (hence a high precision). This is acceptable even if sometimes we let a spam email get through the filter (hence a low recall). Consider a medical pre-screening test which is used to assess if a patient is likely to have a given pathology. The test is cheap (e.g., a blood test) and can be made on a large sample of patients. If the test is positive, we then perform a more expensive but accurate test. In this case, we want to have a high recall. Indeed, if a patient has the pathology, we want to detect it and send the patient for the second, more accurate test (hence a high precision). This is acceptable even if sometimes we have false positives (hence a low precision). Indeed, if we wrongly detect a pathology, the second test will give the correct  \\nresult.  \\nPrecision and recall can often have contrasting values (e.g., we can obtain a high precision but a low recall and vice versa), hence it is generally necessary to look at both numbers together.']\n",

In regression analysis, in particular, we have seen how, when features are highly correlated, we should discard some of them to reduce collinearity.

In particular, we will consider the case of compressing images. An image can be seen as highdimensional data, where the number of dimensions is equal to the number of pixels. For example, an RGB image of size $640\\\\times480$ pixels has $3\\\\cdot640\\\\cdot480=921600$ dimensions.  \\nWe expect that there will be redundant information in all these dimensions. One method to compress images is to divide them into fixed-size blocks (e.g., $8\\\\times8]$ . Each of these blocks will be an element belonging to a population (the population of $8\\\\times8$ blocks of the image).  \\nAssuming that the information in the blocks is highly correlated, we can try to compress it by applying PCA to the sample of blocks extracted from our image and choosing only a few principal components to represent the content of the blocks.  \\nWe will consider the following example image:  \\nImage Size: (427, 640, 3) Number of dimensions: 819840  \\nWe will divide the image into RGB blocks of size $8\\\\times8\\\\times3$ (these are $8\\\\times8$ RGB images).

Determining if a patient has a given pathology: different pathologies might have similar symptoms. Hence, observing some of them does not allow to  \\ndetermine with perfect accuracy if the patient has that pathology. In this case, uncertainty might arise from incomplete observability.', 'Let us consider the random experiment of rolling a die. Our outcomes will be numbers which we read on the top face of the die when it lands.

For instance, think about a system of equations describing the speed of objects according to Newtonian laws.  \\nIn other cases, modeling the relationship between variables in a deterministic way is not possible. We often say that this is due to uncertainty.  \\nAs reported here, uncertainty in a system can be due to different factors:  \\nInherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. Some events such as drawing a card from a deck of cards, rolling a die, or the movements of subatomic particles can be seen as truly random events. The outcomes of such events cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy, so they are stochastic (random).\\nIncomplete observability. Sometimes, even in a deterministic system, we cannot observe anything. For instance, in the Monty Hall problem, the participant to the game is asked to choose between three doors. One of the doors contains a prize, while the others lead to a goat.

      "  - retrieval context: ['We have so far talked about “statistical variables”. When dealing with uncertain events, we need to use the concept of ‘random variables’. Informally (from wikipedia):  \\nA random variable is a variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon.  \\nA random variable is characterized by a set of possible values often called sample space, probability space, or alphabet (this last term comes from information theory, where we often deal with sources emitting symbols from an alphabet, in which case the values of $X$ will be the symbols).  \\nThe definition of a random variable is very similar to that of a statistical variable. Formally, if $\\\\Omega$ is the sample space, we will define a random variable as a function:  \\n$$\\nX:\\\\Omega\\\\to E\\n$$  \\nWhere E is a measurable space and often $E=\\\\mathbb{R}$ . This definition is similar to the one of statistical variable we have given before.  \\nA random variable is generally denoted by a capital letter, such as $X$ .  \\nSimilar to statistical variables, random variables can be discrete or continuous, scalar or multi-dimensional.  \\nThe following table lists some examples.  \\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Discrete</td><td>Continuous</td></tr><tr><td>Scalar</td><td>Tossing a coin</td><td>Height of a person</td></tr><tr><td>Multidimensional</td><td>Pair of dice</td><td>Coordinates of a car</td></tr></table></body></html>', 'Variables can be:  \\nscalar or uni-dimensional: they assume real numbers (e.g., $X=1^{\\\\cdot}$ ) multi-dimensional: they assume vector or matrix values, (e.g., $X={\\\\binom{1}{3}}$ , or $X={\\\\binom{1}{3}}1.$', '5.1.

Common Probability Distributions\\n5.8. Other Distributions (Optional)\\n5.9. References  \\nWe have seen how it is possible to assign a probability value to a given outcome of a random variable.  \\nIn practice, it is often useful to assign probability values to all the values that the random variable can assume.  \\nTo do so, we can define a function, which we will call probability distribution which assigns a probability value to each of the possible values of a random variable.  \\nIn the case of discrete variables, we will talk about “probability mass functions”, whereas in the case of continuous variable, we will refer to “probability density functions”.  \\nA probability distribution characterizes the random variable and defines which outcomes it is more likely to observe.  \\nOnce we find that a given random variable $X$ is characterized by a probability distirbution $P(X)_{\\\\l}$ , we can say that $\"\\\\mathsf{X}$ follows $\\\\mathsf{P}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}$ and write:  \\n$$\\nX\\\\sim P\\n$$', 'If $X$ is discrete, $P(X)$ is called a “probability mass function” (PMF). $P$ maps the values of $X$ to real numbers indicating whether a given value is more or less likely.  \\nA PMF on a random variable $X$ is a function  \\n$$\\nP:\\\\Omega\\\\to[0,1]\\n$$  \\nWhere $\\\\Omega$ is the sample space $X,$ which satisfies the following property:  \\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\Omega}\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{x}){=}\\\\mathbf{1}\\n$$  \\nThis condition implies that the probability distribution is normalized. Also, this means that at least one of the events should happen.  \\nExample: Let $X$ be the random variable indicating the outcome of a coin toss.  \\nThe space of all possible functions (the domain of $P(X))$ is $\\\\{h e a d,\\\\ t a i l\\\\}$ .\\nThe probabilities $P(h e a d)$ and $P(t a i l)$ must be larger than or equal to zero and smaller than or equal to 1.\\nAlso, $P(h e a d)+P(t a i l)=1$ . This is obvious, as one of the two outcomes will always happen. Indeed, if we had $P(t a i l)=0.3,$ this would mean that, 30 times out of 100 times we toss a coin, the outcome will be tail. What will happen in all other cases? The outcome will be head, hence, $P(h e a d)$ , so $P(h e a d)+P(t a i l)=1.$\\nIn the case of a fair coin, we can characterize $P(X)$ as a “discrete uniform distribution”, i.e., a distribution which maps any value $x\\\\in X$ to a constant, such that the properties of the probability mass functions are satisfied.\\nIf we have $N$ possible outcomes, the discrete uniform probability will be $\\\\textstyle P(X=x)={\\\\frac{1}{N}}$ , which means that all outcomes have the same probability.  \\nThis definition satisfies the constraints. Indeed, $\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\geq0}\\\\end{array}$ , $\\\\forall N$ and $\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\sum_{i}P\\\\left(X=x_{i}\\\\right)=1.}\\\\end{array}$']\n",

The analyst starts by defining the question that the data analysis needs to answer (step 1 - define your data analysis question): “What are the common themes and issues in customer reviews, and how can we address them to improve product quality and satisfaction?” To answer this question, the analyst collects a diverse dataset of customer reviews from various sources (step 2 - collect the data needed), including the company’s website, social media, and third-party review platforms. This dataset includes text reviews, ratings, and timestamps.  \\nOnce the data is collected, the analyst proceeds with data cleaning and formatting (step 3 - clean and format the data) since the initial dataset is messy with spelling errors, duplicate reviews, and inconsistent formatting. This involves data preprocessing, such as removing punctuation and converting text to lowercase. After cleaning the data, the analyst explores and describes it (step 4 - explore and describe the data) using techniques like word clouds, frequency distributions, and sentiment analysis to uncover common words, sentiments, and trends within the reviews.  \\nTo extract more meaningful insights from the text data, the analyst decides to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques (step 5 - choose suitable models for analysis). Specifically, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling is chosen to identify recurring themes within the reviews. However, upon implementing LDA and reviewing the results, the analyst realizes that some topics are unclear and overlapping (step 6 - fit, fine-tune, evaluate, and compare the models).  \\nAcknowledging the need to revisit the analysis, the analyst decides to backtrack to the data exploration step (step 4 - explore and describe the data) to gain a deeper understanding of the customer feedback. During this reassessment, it becomes evident that customers frequently mention product quality issues when discussing customer service experiences, leading to topic overlap. Armed with this insight, the analyst decides to categorize reviews into “product-related” and “service-related” (step 5 - choose suitable models for analysis) before applying topic modeling.  \\nWith the revised approach, the analyst proceeds to categorize reviews and then applies LDA separately to the two categories (step 6 - Fit, fine-tune, evaluate, and compare the models for the considered data analysis). This results in more interpretable topics, such as “defective products,” “timely shipping,” and “responsive customer support.” The analyst then analyzes these topics to generate actionable insights for product improvement and customer service enhancements.  \\nTo ensure continuous improvement, the analyst commits to ongoing review and monitoring (step 7 - Review the data analysis when new data is available) of customer reviews, periodically updating the analysis to identify new emerging issues or trends. This iterative approach to data analysis allows for refining strategies and addressing evolving customer concerns over time.', 'Another case of selection bias, arising from cases in which we control for variables we should not control on, is given by the case in which we control on a mediator of the treatment and the outcome. Let us consider this example:  \\nWe want to assess the effect of interest  on performance. Let’s say we could randomize interest (for instance, we selected students with different levels of interest randomly across different schools). “Just to be sure”, we condition on study hours . Conditioning on the mediator closes a path between interest  and performance , hence reducing the measured effect between interest  and performance .  \\nIndeed, while we expect that interested students will study more and obtain better performance, by observing only people who study a lot, interest  and performance  may seem to be little correlated. Indeed, even people with little interest will obtain good performance if they study for long hours.']\n",

This means that it is a parameter of the method affecting the final model we obtain after the optimization procedure, but its value is not automatically determined by the optimization procedure.  \\nOne common approach to determine the values of hyper-parameters is to make some guesses and fit different models with the guessed values of the hyperparameters. We can then choose the model which has the “best value” of the considered hyper-parameters.  \\nWhen it turns to determining the optimal $K$ value for K-Means clustering, there are two main techniques which are commonly used: the elbow method and the silhouette method, which are discussed in the following.  \\nNote that these are both heuristic methods not giving many guarantees on the final selection of $K,$ but they can still help decide on the number of clusters, in particular if guided by an intuition of what a good value of $K$ would look like.', '24.1.

This can be useful in different application scenarios in data analysis:', 'Clustering aims to break the data into distinct group with similar properties. Let us consider the “Old Faithful” dataset, which comprises 272 observations of the eruption of the Old Faithful geyser at the Yellowstone National Park in USA. Each observation includes two variables:  \\nThe duration of the eruption in minutes;\\nThe time in minutes to the next eruption.  \\nWe can see each observation as 2D vector which can be plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system:  \\nWe can see how we clearly have two kinds of eruptions:  \\nShort eruptions followed by other eruptions in a short time (bottom left);\\nLong eruptions followed by other eruptions in a long time (upper right).  \\nA clustering algorithm aims to automatically find the two groups and assign each data point to the most likely group.

While k-means is a popular and widely used algorithm for partitioning data into distinct groups based on similarity, it is one approach among many. Numerous other clustering algorithms offer different perspectives and address specific challenges. Some examples include hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), and spectral clustering. These alternatives provide unique strengths and are tailored to different types of data and scenarios. While our focus has been on understanding clustering in general and the k-means algorithm in particular, it is important to know that other approaches may be more suitable depending on the specific problem at hand. In the next lectures, we will see Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a probabilistic model for density estimation which can also be interpreted as a clustering algorithm.']\n",

      "  - actual output: Randomized experiments, or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), aim to remove bias by randomly assigning individuals to a treatment or control group. The goal of this random assignment is to make the two groups indistinguishable *except* for the treatment itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, random assignment ensures that the potential outcomes are conditionally independent given the treatment:  `Y(0)⊥ Y(1)|T`. This means that if the treatment `T` is fixed, the potential outcomes are independent. For example, knowing the observed exam performance of a student who attended tutoring (`Yᵢ(1)`) doesn't tell you anything about what their exam performance would have been if they hadn't attended tutoring (`Yᵢ(0)`). \n",

      "  - retrieval context: ['We have seen that correlation is causation when the treated and control groups are comparable for everything except the treatment. The most robust method to remove this bias is via randomized experiments, or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT).  \\nA randomized experiment randomly assigns individuals in a population to a treatment or a control group. By performing a random assignment, we wish to make the two groups indistinguishable. Of course one of the two groups will take the treatment and this will likely make the two groups distinguishable, but we wish to make sure that, apart from the treatment, the two groups are indeed indistinguishable.  \\nIt can be shown that random assignment makes sure that the potential outcomes are conditionally independent given the treatment:  \\n$$\\nY(0)\\\\perp Y(1)|T\\n$$  \\nSo, if the treatment $T$ is fixed, the potential outcomes are independent. For instance, if we fix $T=1$ (so we are taking subjects who attended the tutoring), then knowing the observed value $Y_{i}(1)$ (i.e., the observed exam performance of student $i$ ), does not tell me anything about the potential outcome $Y_{i}(0)$ (the exam performance that the same student would obtain if they did not attend the tutoring).  \\nRecall our example on conditional independence: if height and vocabulary are conditionally independent given age, this means that height and vocabulary are independent in the same age groups, while they are not across age groups, so age is the only thing that make height and vocabulary dependent. Similarly, if ${\\\\cal Y}(0)\\\\perp{\\\\cal Y}(1)|T,$ then the treatment is the only thing generating a difference between the outcome in the treated and in the control group.  \\nIf this conditional independence is valid, then:  \\n$$\\nE[Y(0)|T=0]=E[Y(0)|T=1]=E[Y(0)]\\n$$  \\nand:  \\n$$\\nE[Y(1)|T=0]=E[Y(1)|T=1]=E[Y(1)]\\n$$  \\nWhich leads to:  \\n$$\\n1)|T=1|-E[Y(0)|T=0]=E[Y(1)]-E[Y(0)]=E[Y(1)-Y(10|T)].\\n$$  \\nHence, in this case, correlation would be causation.', 'We have seen how to interpret an observed association as a cause-effect relationship we need to reduce bias. The gold standard is to use randomized controlled trials, however this is not always feasible or ethical. Consider for instance the problem of estimating the effect of smoking on the development of a given disease. To perform a randomized experiment, we should select subjects randomly in two groups and ask people in one of the two groups to smoke. This is of course unethical, considering that we suspect that smoking has a bad effect on health.  \\nIn these cases, we can only resort to observational data: we collect data of smokers and non-smokers and observe association in the data. However, we know that this process is subject to bias. How do we deal with it? In this part of the lecture, we will see that graphical causal models give us a framework to set our believes on where bias come from. If we can accurately model the source of bias, we can remove it by controlling on the variable “causing” the bias.  \\nLet us consider our past example: students and tutoring. Let us assume that we cannot perform the random assignment (again, it’s unethical  \\n<html><body><table><tr><td>tutoring</td><td>performance</td><td></td><td>interest</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>76.432447</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>91.550461</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>85.107378</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>69.981030</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>70.111151</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>：</td><td>：</td><td>·</td><td>：</td></tr><tr><td>195</td><td>0</td><td>68.477160</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>196</td><td>0</td><td>87.783594</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>197</td><td>1</td><td>88.220111</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>198</td><td>1</td><td>93.399423</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>199</td><td>1</td><td>84.082421</td><td>4.0</td></tr></table></body></html>  \\n200 rows $\\\\times3$ columns  \\nThese are the same observations as the first case (before random assignment), but with an additional variable. We suspected that interested students have an average higher performance and that interested students are more likely to enroll in the tutoring program. Let us see graphically if this is true. If we split the data by interest and compute the boxplots of performance, we get the following graph:  \\nWe were right$(\\\\circ\\\\mathsf{k},$ this is an exaggerated picture, but this example is made up…)  \\nLet us check how correlated are interest and tutoring  with a barplot:  \\nWe can also check the distribution of interest in the two groups:  \\nWe can go ahead and compute a $\\\\chi^{2}$ test of independence to check if the association between the two variables is statistically significant:  \\nChi-square statistic: 31.22\\nCramer V statistic: 0.40\\nChi-square p-value: 2.761663e-06  \\nWe were right also in this case  \\nThe correlation between the interest  variable and tutoring  is making the “treated” ( tutoring $\\\\scriptstyle1=1$ ) and the “control” ( tutoring $=0$ ) groups not comparable. Indeed, if people in the treated group have more chances of getting a higher  \\nresponse value (performance), then no wonder that we observe such dramatic differences among the two groups', 'We want to test whether a given drug is effective in treating a disease. We will consider a suitable population (e.g., all people affected by the disease), obtain a suitable sample (a random set of people, diverse by age, gender and health conditions) and set up an experiment in which half of the people take the drug, while the remaining half take a placebo. The assignment are randomized to avoid any bias in the data. We will discuss this better when we’ll talk of causal inference.', '19.1. Tutoring vs Performance\\n19.2.

References  \\nWe have seen how to characterize the relationship between two or more variables with correlation and linear regression. We also said that correlation is not causation, meaning that, if we observe a correlation between two variables, that does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship between them. However, in many cases, it is still useful (or required-effect relationship (or lack thereof) between two variables. Consider the following examples:  \\nWe assess that a given disease is more frequent among smokers. Is this just a correlation or is there a cause-effect relationship? If a smoker stops smoking, will their risk to get the disease be reduced?\\nWe develop a new drug and assess that people taking this drug are less likely to get disease X. Is this just a correlation or is there a cause-effect relationship? This is important, as people should take the drug only if benefits are clear.\\nA large company founds that product sites located in the geographical areas close to the sea are more productive than the others. Is this just a correlation or is it a cause-effect relationship? Shall we move all sites closer to the sea?  \\nLuckily, the field of causal analysis has, over the years, developed a set of tools which allow to answer those questions.  \\nThe goal of this lecture is to provide a primer of causal analysis, introducing the main concepts and discussing some techniques which can be applied in some simple cases.']\n",
